# School_District_Analysis_Challenge
Module 4 Challenge - School District Analysis

Overview of the school district analysis:

The school board has notified Maria and her supervisor that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards and have turned to Maria for help. She has asked you to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once youâ€™ve replaced the math and reading scores, Maria would like you to repeat the school district analysis that you did in this module and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.

This new assignment consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report to present your results. You will submit the following:

Deliverable 1: Replace ninth-grade reading and math scores\n
Deliverable 2: Repeat the school district analysis\n
Deliverable 3: A written report for the school district analysis\n

Results:

At some point along the process my student_data_complete_df didn't get updated for the NaN's updated to THS grade 9 scores. So there are no differences between my results and the module results.
